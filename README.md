# Climate_Analysis
In this project I explore NOAA climate data to discover relationships between my two favorite cities; Detroit and Chicago.

1. First I scraped the raw HTML text from the NOAA website. In python, I then utilized beautiful soup and Pandas to transform the data into a dataframe before then turning the DF's into a complete CSV file.
2. I then imported the datasets into SQL where i cleaned, standardized, and performed vairous Joins and aggregations to discover relationships to answer questions.
3. I imported the cleaned data from SQL to Tableau to better visualize my findings to get a clearer understanding of what im looking at, and to prepare for presentation
4. Finally, I return back to python where I utilize scipy.stats and numpy to perform Statistical testing to see how our local datasets sample compares against national statistics.
