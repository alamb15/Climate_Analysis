# Climate_Analysis
In this project I explore NOAA climate data to discover relationships between my two favorite cities; Detroit and Chicago.

1. I scrape the raw HTML text from NOAA website, and in python utilizing beautiful soup, I utilize Pandas to transform data into a dataframe for both datasets before turning the Df into a CSV file
2. I then import the datasets into SQL where i clean, standardize, and perform vairous Joins and aggregations to discover relationships and seek out questions.
3. I import the cleaned data into Tableau to better visualize my findings in SQL to get a clearer understanding of what im looking at, and to prepare for presentation
4. Finally, I return back to python where I utilize scipy.stats and numpy to perform Statistical testing to compare averages against a larger population
